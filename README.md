# Crossing Reality

Undergraduate dissertation that presented a software toolkit that facilitates development of cross reality systems leveraging wireless sensor networks, actuators and virtual worlds. The toolkit allows physical and environmental changes in the state of a real world location to be sensed and reflected in a simulation of that location in a virtual world, whilst certain avatar-induced actions in the virtual world are reflected in the real world by actuators.

A demo application of the toolkit is included that uses the Tmote Invent wireless sensor network platform for detecting changes in the real world, the Phidgets platform for actuating changes in the real world, and the OpenSim platform as the virtual environment.
